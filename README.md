# webR welcome

Discovered webR and quarto at posit conf 2023 and wanted to try it out.

these files come with `quarto add coatless/quarto-webr`
- `_extensions/`
- `webr-serviceworker.js`
- `webr-worker.js`

these are built by `quarto render index.qmd`
- `index.html`
- `index_files/`

This is rendered to GitHub pages via [this method](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command)

## revealjs slides

[This worked](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/14#issuecomment-1507961223), but not sure how good of a format this is. The console output can run off the page in this verion.
