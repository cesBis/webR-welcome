# webR welcome

Discovered webR and quarto at posit conf 2023 and wanted to try it out.

these files come with `quarto add coatless/quarto-webr`
- `_extensions/`
- `webr-serviceworker.js`
- `webr-worker.js`

these are built by `quarto render index.qmd`
- `index.html`
- `index_files/`

This is rendered to GitHub pages via [this method](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command)
